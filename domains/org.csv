This blog offers the opportunity for participants to discuss new trends in American Spaces, specifically those focused on &ldquo;making and doing.&rdquo;  The contributors to &ldquo;Makers in American Spaces&rdquo;  come from around the globe and work in or with U.S. Embassy Information Resource Centers, American Corners, Binational Centers, and other American Spaces partners overseas. Some of us are seasoned makers, while others are just starting out; what unites us is our appreciation for the creativity, experimentation, and collaboration that makerspaces foster.  We hope this blog community provides inspiration for ideas and information sharing.  Have something to contribute? Please contact us by emailing us at this address: makersinspaces@state.gov.

westcoastcollaborative.org,,,,Quasigovernmental,,,"THE WEST COAST COLLABORATIVE The West Coast Collaborative (Collaborative) is an ambitious public-private partnership between leaders from federal, state, and local government, the private sector, academia, and environmental groups committed to reducing diesel emissions and advancing clean air technologies and practices along the West Coast of North America. The Collaborative is part of the National Clean Diesel Campaign (NCDC), which seeks to advance strategies to reduce diesel emissions and move toward cleaner air by working with diesel fleet, engine and emission control technology owners, operators, developers and manufacturers; air quality professionals; environmental and community organizations; and federal, state and local officials. To advance diesel  emission reductions, Congress Authorized funding for clean diesel activities in the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) as part of the 2005 Energy Policy Act. The Collaborative aims to reduce diesel emissions through verified and certified technologies, engines and practices, and advances innovative emission reduction technologies and practices. The Collaborative also helps coordinate regional efforts for cleaner fuels and the Clean School Bus USA program. EPA launched, but does not control the Collaborative. n  From https://www.westcoastcollaborative.org/about.htm ; Retrieved December 23, 2016 -- Note added 12/23/16 21:12",https://www.westcoastcollaborative.org/,12/23/16 20:36
